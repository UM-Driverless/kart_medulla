# Tasks

The repo's task board — the only one. Update status as you go: `TODO → In Progress → Done`. Read
before editing; claim by adding `[YYYY-MM-DD <name>]` and the section change. Big clusters get a
`tasks/<name>.md`, always linked from an index here.

Only Rubén moves a task to Done. "Looks finished" is not the same as confirmed on the hardware — on
this repo that means flashed *and* driven, per the branch workflow in `AGENTS.md`.

## TODO

### Compressor bench test (next up)

- **Run the 60% soft-start on the bench and feel the MOSFET.** The gate is driven from 3.3 V
  through a series resistor, so it switches slowly and never fully enhances; Rds(on) is worse than
  the datasheet's Vgs=10 V figure. Because the duty is a permanent 60% (the motor is 7.5 V on a
  12 V rail), the MOSFET switches continuously and never rests at DC — so switching loss is a
  standing condition. If it runs hot, lower `COMPRESSOR_PWM_FREQ_HZ` (`km_gpio.h`) or add a gate
  driver; never raise the duty. See `history.md` 2026-07-16.
- **Measure the actual rail voltage before trusting the 60% figure.** `COMPRESSOR_DUTY_RUN` = 153
  assumes a 12 V rail, giving 0.60 x 12 = 7.2 V for a 7.5 V motor. If the rail actually sits at
  13.8 V, 60% delivers 8.3 V and the motor is overvolted — the duty would need lowering.
- **Confirm the soft-start actually fixed the comms drop.** The ground-loop write-up (`history.md`
  2026-07-16) predicts the USB port stops dropping when the compressor starts. Watch telemetry
  across a full pump-up cycle; the duty ramp is now in the `ESP_ACT_STEERING` payload and
  `read_telemetry.py` prints it live.
- **Calibrate `ADC_1_BAR` / `ADC_2_BAR` in `main.c`.** They are currently a guessed linear map
  (1 bar = 819, 2 bar = 1638) with a comment admitting as much. The hysteresis thresholds that
  decide when the compressor runs are only as good as these numbers.

### ESP32-S3 firmware gaps (from `km_gpio.h`; block running on the real board)

- **`KM_GPIO_WriteDAC()` is not ported to the MCP4922.** It still calls the classic
  `dac_output_voltage()`, which the S3 does not have — throttle and brake do nothing on the S3.
- **Nothing drives `PIN_SDC_NOT_EMERGENCY` (GPIO 18).** R23's pulldown holds it off at boot, so the
  kart sits in emergency until firmware drives it HIGH. Until then it cannot be armed. **Safety —
  read the pin's note in `.agents/esp32s3-pinmap.md` before touching.**
- **Nothing drives `PIN_SELECT_THROTTLE` (GPIO 15).** R32's 10 kΩ pulldown makes the default pedal
  pass-through (safe); firmware must drive it HIGH for throttle-via-DAC.
- **`PIN_STATUS_LED` (GPIO 48) needs RMT**, not plain GPIO — it's an addressable RGB.

### Libraries (migrated from the old `TODO.md`, 2026-07-16 — written in Spanish, unverified)

These are inherited from the original author's list. **Several look stale** — `km_objects`,
`km_sta`, `km_gamc` and the `main` structure all exist now — but "the file exists" is not the same
as "the task is done", so none are marked Done here. Verify against the code, then let Rubén close
them.

- **`km_coms`**: test the return message to the ESP32; do payload formatting on both the Orin and
  the ESP32 side. Intended flow — receive: `UART buffer → library buffer → (format message, queue
  it) → format payload by message type`; send: `format payload by message type → UART buffer`.
- **`main`**: build out the whole structure. (Looks done — `main.c` has the task set up and
  running; confirm nothing from the original plan is missing.)
- **State machine library**: write it entirely. (`km_sta` exists — check whether it is actually
  implemented or a stub.)
- **Storage library**: a library that creates 'objects' that stay saved, so asking for information
  about something just means asking for the object. (`km_objects` exists and `main.c` uses it —
  likely done.)
- **`km_gamc`**: write the library to handle the gamepads. (`km_gamc` exists; `main.c` includes it.
  Note `sketch.cpp` is the legacy Bluepad32 gamepad app and is NOT used by `main.c`.)
- **Move everything pin-related into the gpio library** (the original entry ends in "???" — it was
  a question, not a decision. Largely true already; decide whether anything is left.)
- **Modernize the DAC and LEDC drivers now that everything is configured.** The build currently
  warns on both: "legacy adc driver is deprecated, migrate to `esp_adc/adc_oneshot.h`" and "the
  legacy DAC driver is deprecated, use `driver/dac_oneshot.h`". Worth doing alongside the MCP4922
  port above, since that rewrites the DAC path anyway.

### Cross-repo

- **`dv-hardware`'s exported netlist is stale and misleading — belongs on that repo's board.**
  `projects/kart-medulla/output/netlist.net` is dated 7 May while `kart-medulla_P1.kicad_sch` was
  edited 9 May. The stale export shows *both* Q3's and Q4's gates connected to no net at all, which
  cannot be true of a board whose SDC MOSFET works. Anyone answering a connectivity question from
  that file will get a wrong answer. Re-export it.

## In Progress

## Done

- [2026-07-16] **Compressor soft-start**: `CMD_COMPRESSOR_PWM` (GPIO 3) moved from a digital on/off
  output to LEDC PWM on its own timer at 500 Hz, ramping 0 → 60% duty over 1 s from the pressure
  hysteresis rising edge. Duty added to the `ESP_ACT_STEERING` telemetry payload. Builds for both
  S3 and the classic fallback. **Not validated on hardware** — see the bench test under TODO.
